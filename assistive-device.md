## Version Control for Assistive Devices Project
## Introduction :
 -- This document outlines the steps to implement version control for the development of assistive devices and how to track progress using GitHub.

## Table of Concents:
 - [Setting up Version Control]
 - [GitHub Repository]
 - [Branching Strategy]
 - [Issue Tracking]

## Setting up version Control:
  -- To imp ement version control for assistive devices, we'll use Git the version control system . Make sure Git is install on your local machine.

  ''bash
   Install Git on Linux
    sudo apt-get install git

    #Install Git on marOS
     brew install git

     # Install Git on Windows 
      Down oad and install from  https://git-scm.com/download/win

      #Initiakuze a Git repository in your project directory
       git.init

  ## GitHub Repository:
   -- Create a new repository on GitHub for your assistive devices project.
  ## Clone the repository to your local machine:
     -- git clone https://github.com/your-user-name/assistive-devices.git

  ## Branching Srategy:
   -- Follow branching strategy to manage the development process effectively. Here's and example.

   master: Represent the stable production-ready code.
   develop: Integration branch for ongoing development.
   feature/[feature-name]:Feature branches for new feature.
   bugfix/[bug-description]: Bugfix branches for addressing issues.

  ## Issue Tacking:
   -- Use GitHub Issue to track tasks , enhancements, and bugs. Each issue should have a clear title, description and lablels for categorization.
  ## Pull Requests:
    -- When a feature or bugfix is ready, submit a pull request to merge the changes into the develop branch.

  ## Create a new brach:
    -- git checkout -b feature/ new-feature

  # Make your changes and commit:
     'bash
      git add .
      git commit -m "Implement new feature"

  ## Push Changes to GitHub:
  'bash
   git push origin feature/new-feature

   ## Continuous Integration:

    -- Implement continuous integration to automate testing and ensure code quality. Use tools like GitHut Action or Jenkins to run tests on each pull request.

  ## Example:
  GitHut Action workflow
 ##  create a main.yml file:

   name: CI
   cn:
    push:
     branches:
      -develop

  jobs:
  build:
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest

## steps:
 -name : Checkout repository
 uses:actions/checkout@ve
  -name : Set up Node.js
   uses : actions/setup-node@v3
   with: node -version:"14" 

  -name : Install dependencies
  run: npm install

  -name : Run tests
  run: npm test

#### Conclusion 

By following these steps , you effectively implement version control for assistive devices and track progress using GitHub. 
Remember to adapt these guidlines to the specific needs and scale of your project.
